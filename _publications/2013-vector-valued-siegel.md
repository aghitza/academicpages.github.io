abstract: 'We carry out some computations of vector valued Siegel modular forms of
  degree two, weight $(k, 2)$ and level one. Our approach is based on Satoh''s description
  of the module of vector-valued Siegel modular forms of weight $(k, 2)$ and an explicit
  description of the Hecke action on Fourier expansions. We highlight three experimental
  results: (1) we identify a rational eigenform in a three-dimensional space of cusp
  forms, (2) we observe that non-cuspidal eigenforms of level one are not always rational
  and (3) we verify a number of cases of conjectures about congruences between classical
  modular forms and Siegel modular forms.'
