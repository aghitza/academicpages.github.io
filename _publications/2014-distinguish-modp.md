abstract: Consider the Fourier expansions of two elements of a given space of modular
  forms. How many leading coefficients must agree in order to guarantee that the two
  expansions are the same? Sturm gave an upper bound for modular forms of a given
  weight and level. This was adapted by Ram Murty, Kohnen and Ghitza to the case of
  two eigenforms of the same level but having potentially different weights. We consider
  their expansions modulo a prime ideal, presenting a new bound. In the process of
  analysing this bound, we generalise a result of Bach and Sorenson, who provide a
  practical upper bound for the least prime in an arithmetic progression.
