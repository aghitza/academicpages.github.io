abstract: We show that the systems of Hecke eigenvalues occurring in the spaces of
  Siegel modular forms (mod $p$) of fixed dimension $g$, fixed level $N$, and varying
  weight, are the same as the systems occurring in the spaces of Siegel cusp forms
  with the same parameters and varying weight. In particular, in the case $g=1$, this
  says that the Hecke eigensystems (mod $p$) coming from classical modular forms are
  the same as those coming from cusp forms. The proof uses restriction to the superspecial
  locus. We also give a comparison of cusp forms on the Satake compactification versus
  the toroidal compactifications of Siegel modular varieties.
