Let $n_0(N, k)$ be the number of initial Fourier coefficients necessary to distinguish newforms of level $N$ and even weight $k$.
We produce extensive data to support our conjecture that if $N$ is a fixed squarefree positive integer and $k$ is sufficiently large, then $n_0(N, k)$ is the least prime that does not divide $N$.
