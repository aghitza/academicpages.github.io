abstract: We derive an explicit upper bound for the number of systems of Hecke eigenvalues
  coming from Siegel modular forms (mod $p$) of dimension $g$ and level $N$ relatively
  prime to $p$. In the special case of elliptic modular forms ($g=1$), our result
  agrees with an independently-obtained bound appearing in the PhD thesis of L. Clay.
