abstract: We describe a computational approach to the verification of Maeda's conjecture
  for the Hecke operator $T_2$ on the space of cusp forms of level one. We provide
  experimental evidence for all weights less than $12000$, as well as some applications
  of these results. The algorithm was implemented using the mathematical software
  Sage, and the code and resulting data were made freely available.
