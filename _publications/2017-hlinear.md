We present an implementation in the functional programming language Haskell of the PLE decomposition of matrices over division rings. Our benchmarks indicate that it is competitive with the C-based implementation provided in Flint. Describing the guiding principles of our work, we introduce the reader to basic ideas from high-performance functional programming.
