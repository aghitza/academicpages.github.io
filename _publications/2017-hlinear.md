abstract: We present an implementation in the functional programming language Haskell
  of the PLE decomposition of matrices over division rings. Our benchmarks indicate
  that it is competitive with the C-based implementation provided in Flint. Describing
  the guiding principles of our work, we introduce the reader to basic ideas from
  high-performance functional programming.
