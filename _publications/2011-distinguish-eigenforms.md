abstract: We revisit a theorem of Ram Murty about the number of initial Fourier coefficients
  that two cuspidal eigenforms of different weights can have in common. We prove an
  explicit upper bound on this number, and give better conditional and unconditional
  asymptotic upper bounds. Finally, we describe a numerical experiment testing the
  sharpness of the upper bound in the case of forms of level one.
