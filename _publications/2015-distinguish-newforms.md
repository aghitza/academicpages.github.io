abstract: Let $n_0(N,k)$ be the number of initial Fourier coefficients necessary to
  distinguish newforms of level $N$ and even weight $k$. We produce extensive data
  to support our conjecture that if $N$ is a fixed squarefree positive integer and
  $k$ is large then $n_0(N,k)$ is the least prime that does not divide $N$.
