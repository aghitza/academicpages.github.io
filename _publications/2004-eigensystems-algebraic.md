abstract: In a letter to Tate, Serre proves that the systems of Hecke eigenvalues
  given by modular forms (mod $p$) are the same as the ones given by locally constant
  functions on an adelic double coset space constructed from the endomorphism algebra
  of a supersingular elliptic curve. We generalize this result to Siegel modular forms
  (mod $p$), proving that the systems of Hecke eigenvalues obtained from them are
  the same as the ones given by algebraic modular forms (mod $p$) on a quaternionic
  unitary group, as defined by Gross. The correspondence is obtained by restricting
  to the superspecial locus of the moduli space of abelian varieties.
