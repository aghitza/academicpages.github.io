I am a senior lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of Melbourne, in Australia.
My research is in arithmetic algebraic geometry, an area at the intersection of number theory and algebraic geometry.
I am also interested in computational aspects of number theory, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other algebraic topics.
