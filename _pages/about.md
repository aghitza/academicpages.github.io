**BEWARE: I am in the middle of migrating my page to this location. If you somehow arrived at this page, please note that it is not really meant to be useful yet. I suggest you visit the** [current working page](http://aghitza.org) **instead.**

I am a [senior lecturer][ausedu] in [Pure Mathematics][ms] at the [University of Melbourne][unimelb], in Australia.
My research is in [arithmetic algebraic geometry][arithgeo], an area at the intersection of [number theory][numthy] and [algebraic geometry][alggeo].
I am also interested in computational aspects of number theory, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other algebraic topics.

I am currently on SSP (sabbatical) leave until the end of February 2018.
